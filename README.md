Objected-oriented programming contains classes, you create objects based on these classes.
I will learn to write classes and create instances of those classes. I'll specify the kind of information that can be stored
in instances, and I'll define actions that can be taken with these instances. I'll also write classes that exten the functionality
of existing classes, similar classes can share code efficiently. I'll store my classes in modules and import
classes written by other programmers into my own program files.
